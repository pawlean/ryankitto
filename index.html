      <h1>Welcome to your new training & nutrition plan!</h1>
      <p>I have spent the past 3 weeks of lockdown devising the perfect plan to
        try and help you to...

          <ol>1) <b>Maintain</b> the STRENGTH and hard-earned MUSCLE you have
            worked so hard to achieve in the gym and potentially BUILD new
            <b>muscle tissue</b> without the use of gym equipment!
            <ul><li>Sure, doing live, at home HIIT cardio workouts and going for a run will
            help burn bodyfat, but too much of this could lead to you burning off all
            that lean muscle too! I‚Äôm not saying stop doing it, but this plan I have
            written will help you to build a solid physique alongside a sensible amount
            of cardio ‚Äì paired with a vitamin and nutrient enriched diet plan this will
            also help your immune system to fight off any unwanted invaders!
          </li> </ul>
          </ol>
          <ol>2) Learn all the <b>secret nutritional tricks and tips</b> I have picked up
            from the Pro‚Äôs over the years and used myself to <b>win</b> Men‚Äôs
            Physique competitions and bring out my abs for photoshoots.
            These tips also help me <b>stay lean year round.</b></ol>
            <ol>3) Turn <b>standard household objects</b> into your very own HOME
              GYM! You wouldn‚Äôt believe the possibilities you have with a bag
              for life and a rucksack!</ol>
              <ol>4) Learn new bodyweight / <b>calisthenic</b> movements you can do in the
                safety of your <b>own home.</b></ol>
                <ol>5) <b>Stay mentally focused</b> in a solid routine, <b>burn body fat, get
                  pumped</b>, have fun and feel amazing!</ol>
